# Sudoku Solver w/ backtracking

## Summary
This app allows the playing of sudoku puzzles and also includes the ability to engage an auto-solver to finish the 
puzzle. It uses a backtracking algorithm combined with traditional sudoku logic to solve any puzzle in fractions of a second, 
including those puzzles that were created to inhibit backtracking.

###Controls:
select a cell: mouse / arrow keys

enter digits: number keys 

clear digits: delete or backspace

auto-solve: Shift + Spacebar


### Future Additions
If I expand the project then I could add the following:

+ coloring of cells
+ finish the sidebar to include buttons
+ add a dropdown menu to select one of the precreated puzzles
